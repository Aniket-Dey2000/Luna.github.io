      <h2>The night walked down the sky with the moon in her hand.</h2>
      <p>
        The moon, the largest and brightest object in the night sky, has long
        inspired curiosity and wonder. It appears at night, the time of sleep
        and dreaming that sometimes seems to approach the borders of death and
        the afterlife. Radiating an air of mystery and magic, the moon is also
        associated with love and often serves as a symbol of unattainable
        beauty. Unlike the sun, the moon does not present the same face every
        day. It waxes, or grows larger, until it becomes a glowing silver-white
        disk. Then night by night it wanes, or shrinks, to a curved sliver until
        it vanishes altogether. A few days later a slender new moon appears and
        begins to grow again in an endless cycle that

        People once believed that moonlight had a powerful effect on human
        behavior. Those who acted strangely were said to be "moonstruck," and
        lunacy, a term for madness, comes from Luna, the Latin name for the moon
        goddess. The Japanese believed that the moon was a god with powers to
        foretell the future. Priests would study the moon's reflection in a
        mirror, believing that if they gazed directly at the moon, it might
        drive them mad. Superstitions about the moon's evil influence made some
        people refuse to sleep in a place where moonbeams could touch them. In
        the 1200s, the English philosopher Roger Bacon wrote, "Many have died
        from not protecting themselves from the rays of the moon."

        legends explain the appearance of the moon, whose mottled surface has
        suggested various shapes and identities. The "man in the moon" is one
        common interpretation thought to have originated from the biblical book
        of Numbers, which describes a man carrying a load of sticks. People have
        also interpreted the shapes as frogs and toads, and rabbits in the moon
        occur in many mythologies. In China and Japan the lunar rabbit is said
        to mix a potion that gives immortality.

        The mountains stand eternal, a witness to history. Sometimes a fading
        gray historical marker will dot the landscape in an effort to inform
        motorists of people and events someone wishes remembered. More likely,
        the past hides unnoticed in history books or passed along with a mix of
        legends and myth in our mountain lore.

        The Earth asked Vishnu, “Why do you come in the form of mountains and
        not in your own form?” Vishnu replied: “The pleasure that exists in
        mountains is greater than that of animate beings, for they feel no heat,
        nor cold, nor pain, nor anger, nor fear, nor pleasure. We three gods as
        mountains will reside in the earth for the benefit of mankind.”
